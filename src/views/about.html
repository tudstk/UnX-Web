                <h2>System Features</h2><br>
                <p>
                    &#x2022;<b>Authentication:</b> The Authentication Module in Unemployment Explorer provides user registration and login functionality using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This module ensures secure access to the website and stores user information in a database. User passwords are hashed before being stored to enhance security. The user registration process involves users providing their desired username, email address, and password, followed by validation and secure storage of their information in the database. Upon successful registration, users receive a unique authentication token (JWT) for future logins. The user login process involves users entering their registered username/email and password, which are then validated against existing accounts. If successful, a new JWT is generated and returned for authentication purposes.
                    <br>
                    <br>&#x2022;<b>Administration:</b> The Administration Module in UnX empowers authorized administrators with the ability to manage user accounts and feedback submissions. Administrators can efficiently add and delete user accounts, ensuring effective user management. Within the user management interface, administrators provide relevant user details, including username, email address, and password, which are then validated by the system. Duplicate username or email entries are carefully checked to prevent conflicts. Additionally, administrators can oversee feedback submissions, allowing them to review, analyze, and take appropriate actions based on the received feedback. This comprehensive administration module offers a streamlined approach to user and feedback management within Unemployment Explorer.
